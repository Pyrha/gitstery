"Mrs. Toller!" cried Miss Hunter.

"Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a

"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know."

"Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that

"I will soon make it clear to you," said she; "and I'd have done so before now if I could ha' got

that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's friend too.
