Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and
a compressed lip to this long narrative.

"Excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this
public manner."

"Then you won't forgive me? You won't shake hands before I go?"

"I had hoped," suggested Holmes, "that you would have joined us in a friendly supper."

"I think that there you ask a little too much," responded his Lordship. "I may be forced to
acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I
think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night." He included us all in a
sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.
