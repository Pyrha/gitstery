"It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our
being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and
the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of

that it is unwise to place one's self under obligations.'

"'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?' I asked.
