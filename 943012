He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping
down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor
of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was
buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his
sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words
with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage
at the hands of fortune.

"We have retained these things for some days," said Holmes, "because we expected to see an
advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise."

Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they
once were," he remarked. "I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off
both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering
them."

"Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it."

"To eat it!" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.
