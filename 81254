"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. Boone, as I have told you, was
arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been
anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to

there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are all as far from a
solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the

through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.
