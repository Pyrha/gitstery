"I cannot, and I will not, believe it!" cried the banker with an ashen face.

"I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she
thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into
the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She
told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will.
I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all
other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions
when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of
the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly true.

"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his
uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so
he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage
until she disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some
clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair. Presently she
emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the
precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along
and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath.
He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then
closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the
curtain.
