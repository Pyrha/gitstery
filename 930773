Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its ragged edge
that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath were the
following enigmatical notices:

"Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor. "And now you must on
no account lose another instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You
must get home instantly and act."

"What shall I do?"

"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put this piece of paper which you
have shown us into the brass box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say that
all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which remains. You
must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you must at
once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?"
