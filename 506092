"Very strange!" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. "There are one or two very singular points
about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room,
when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!"

"That is also quite modern," said the lady.

"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked Holmes.

"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time."

"They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do
not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner
apartment."
