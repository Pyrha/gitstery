Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion's knees. "For God's
sake, have mercy!" he shrieked. "Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I
never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring
it into court! For Christ's sake, don't!"

"Get back into your chair!" said Holmes sternly. "It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you
thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing."

"I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break
down."

"Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the
stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies
your only hope of safety."
