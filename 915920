"The right side? You're mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here."

"And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply."

"There's nothing in it. I looked at it before," said Lestrade.

"'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.' I see
nothing in that."

"Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at
least the initials are, so I congratulate you again."

"I've wasted time enough," said Lestrade, rising. "I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the
fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the
matter first." He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.
