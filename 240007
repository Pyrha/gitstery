"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes.  "You may rely upon my doing all that
I can."

"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some
flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?"

"I think that it is very probable."

"There, now!" she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. "You hear! He
gives me hopes."

Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming
his conclusions," he said.

"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his
father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was
concerned in it."
