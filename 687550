I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.

Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he laid
the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in
darkness.

How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a
breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state
of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited
in absolute darkness.
