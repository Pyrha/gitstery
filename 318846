Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed
my questioning glances. "Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that
he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a
considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."

Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my
companion.

"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know,
for example, that I did manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's carpenter."

"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked
with it, and the muscles are more developed."
